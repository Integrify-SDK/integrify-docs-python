# Development - Contributing

First and foremost (and the easiest), you can star the repository.

## Translation { #translation }

Most of the documentations are in one language (either in Azerbaijani or in English). One can help with translating these pages. Just copy existing documenatation folder (`docs/az` or `docs/en`) and translate the content.

## Issue

You can also contribute by creating new issue, be it new feature request or pointing out a bug. When indicating bug, it is highly recommended to share OS and library version.

## Development

It must be understood that, even though Integrify was monorepo project before, it was later divided into multiple repos: repository per integration. This way changes in one integration does not affect others. Furthermore, we use [python namespace packaging](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/) logic for our library.

If you want to work with existing integration, fork it and work on it. Open PR after you work is done, and it will be reviewed and merged.

If you want to work on a new integration, open issue at [integrify-docs](https://github.com/Integrify-SDK/integrify-docs-python/issues/new). New repository will be created for you, and as mentioned before, you can just fork it and start working on it.

Start contributing by following next steps. For easier process, it is recommended to frequently use tests and linting in you local environment.

!!! tip

    **tl;dr:** To format the code, use `make format`. For testing and linting use `make test` and `make lint` respectively. To generate docs use `make docs`.

### Requisites { #requisites }

* Python version between 3.9 və 3.13
* git
* make
* [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
* [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)

### Installation  { #installation }

```bash
# Clone the project and cd into it
git clone git@github.com:<your username>/integrify-integration_name-python.git
cd integrify-integration_name-python

# download uv (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#standalone-installer)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
# For windows `powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | more"`

# Setup
uv sync
make setup
```

### New branch  { #new-branch }

```bash
# Checkout to new branch
git checkout -b my-new-feature-branch
# Add your changes...
```

???+ warning

    Have logical branch name:

    * For bugfix: `bug/branch-name`
    * For new API and endpoints: `api/integration-name`
    * Small fix: `fix/branch-name`
    * Doc based: `docs/branch-name`

### Test and Linting { #test-and-linting }

After finishing the work with code, test and lint the code:

```bash
make format
# Integrify uses Rust-based linter: ruff
# https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff

make all
# This command executes multiple other commands (`format`, `lint`, `type-check və `test`)
```

### Generate docs { #generate-docs }

If you added or changed any signature or docstring, generate new documentation. [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) is used for general documentation and [`mkdocstrings`](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/) for docstrings.

```bash
# Generate docs
make docs
# Make sure this command does not fail

# If you use `make docs-serve` command, you can see new documentation at localhost:8000.
```

However, consider that the main file is `docs/partial.yml`, which is read by [docs repo](https://github.com/Integrify-SDK/integrify-docs-python) and generates its `mkdocs.yml`.

### Commit, Push and PR  { #commit-push-and-pr }

After finishing writing, commit and push to your new branch, and create pull request to original repository.

If your code is ready for review, please indicate that in comments. It will be reviewed and merged.

## Code Architecture (!) { #code-architecture }

As this part needs to be detailed, it has its [own page](./code-architecture.md).

## Documentation { #documentation }

All documentation is written in markdown and generated with  [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). API documentation is generated from docstrings with [mkdocstrings](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/)

Overall, documentation should be clear and understandable. It should be short and precise.

### In-code documentation style { #incode-documentation-style }

Make sure that everything that user might need should be documented. The following should ALWAYS be documented:

* Modules
* Classes
* Functions
* Module scope variables

Integrify is using [Google-style docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings) with [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) format standarts. For more info check: [Example Google Style Python Docstrings](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html)

You can show example of the function in docstrings. These examples should be fully working code.
